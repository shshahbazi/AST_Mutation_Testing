# AST_Mutation_Testing
This project implements a **mutation testing tool** in **Python** using **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)**.  
It was developed as the final project for the *Software Testing* course.  

The tool automatically applies small changes (mutations) to the source code and evaluates whether the existing test suite can detect these changes. This provides a stronger measure of test effectiveness compared to traditional code coverage.

##  Features

- **AST-based approach**: Mutations are applied directly to the Abstract Syntax Tree of Python programs.  
- **Operator mutations**: Includes arithmetic, bitwise, and logical operator replacements.  
- **Test execution**: Integrates with `pytest` to automatically run tests on mutated code.  
- **Mutation score**: Calculates the mutation score as a metric of test effectiveness.  
- **Result reporting**: Provides insights into test strengths, weaknesses, and possible improvements.
